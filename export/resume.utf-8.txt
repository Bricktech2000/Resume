𝗟𝗧𝗥𝗘 𝗥𝗲𝗴𝗲𝘅 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲 <https://github.com/Bricktech2000/LTRE>
[A fast regular expression library written in C99]                                               C
  • Built  regex engine in C99 that compiles regular expressions down to minimal deterministic
    finite automata to match input strings in 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 without backtracking.
  • Wrote  extensive  test  suite of over 𝟯𝟬𝟬 𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁𝘀 to ensure end-to-end correctness of engine
    and catch regressions.
  • Developed  grep-like  tool as real-world stress test for engine, with command-line options
    for  case-insensitive  and  smart-case  matching,  fixed-string  patterns,  full-match and
    partial-match searches, and more.
