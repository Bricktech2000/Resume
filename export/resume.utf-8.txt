[A minimalist 8-bit microcomputer with stack-based microprocessor]            Rust • C • Assembly
• Designed ecosystem of hardware and software from logic gates upward, including instruction
  set architecture, from-scratch assembler and cross-platform emulator, totaling over 𝟮𝟬 𝟬𝟬𝟬
  𝗦𝗟𝗢𝗖 and 𝟳𝟱𝟬 𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀 of work.
• Wrote  various  demos  in  Assembly  running  natively on microcomputer — memory monitor •
  sprite editor • Tetris clone • native assembler • postfix notation calculator.
• Built microcomputer in hardware using discrete 74HC-series logic chips on breadboards.

𝗔𝘁𝘁𝗼-𝟴 𝗖 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗶𝗹𝗲𝗿
[A rudimentary C99 compiler for the Atto-8 microarchitecture]                 Rust • C • Assembly
• Building  C99 compiler from sctatch in Rust targeting Atto-8 Assembly language, consisting
  of preprocessor, parser, typechecker, optimizer and code generator.
• Implemented  dead  code  elimination, constant folding and strength reduction resulting in
  average of 𝟮𝟬% 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲 in execution speed and 𝟭𝟬% 𝗿𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 in binary size.
• Developed  extensive  C  standard  library, including heap allocator supporting 𝗺𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗼𝗰 𝗮𝗻𝗱
  𝗳𝗿𝗲𝗲,  string  handling  functions  such  as  𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗹𝗲𝗻  𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗺𝗲𝗺𝗰𝗽𝘆 and input/output routines
  including 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗳 supporting conversion specifiers %d, %u, %x, %c, %s and %p.

𝗟𝗧𝗥𝗘 𝗥𝗲𝗴𝗲𝘅 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲 <https://github.com/Bricktech2000/LTRE>
[A fast regular expression library written in C99]                                              C
• Built  regex engine in C99 which compiles regular expressions down to deterministic finite
  automata to match input strings in 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 without backtracking.
• Wrote extensive test suite of over 𝟭𝟬𝟬 𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁𝘀 to ensure end-to-end correctness of engine.
• Developed  grep-like tool supporting flags -v, -x, -i, -n and -c as real-world stress test
  for engine.

𝗗𝗕𝗟𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗣𝗮𝘀𝘀𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗱 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗿 <https://github.com/Bricktech2000/DBLess>
[A hash-based, database-less password manager]                                         C • Python
• Devised  custom cryptographic procedure based on SHA-256 in Python which deterministically
  generates passwords on demand without requiring encryption or password storage.
• Reimplemented password generation algorithm in C for use as interactive CLI tool.
