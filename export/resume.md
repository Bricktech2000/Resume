## Projects

### [Atto-8 Microcomputer](https://github.com/Bricktech2000/Atto-8)

_A minimalist 8-bit microcomputer with stack-based microprocessor_ `Rust • Assembly`

- Designed ecosystem of hardware and software from logic gates upward, including [instruction set architecture](https://github.com/Bricktech2000/Atto-8/blob/master/spec/microarchitecture.md), [from-scratch assembler](https://github.com/Bricktech2000/Atto-8/tree/master/asm) and [cross-platform emulator](https://github.com/Bricktech2000/Atto-8/tree/master/emu), totaling over **15 000 SLOC** and **500 hours** of work.
- Wrote various demos in Assembly running natively on microcomputer — [memory monitor](https://github.com/Bricktech2000/Atto-8/blob/master/test/utils/attomon.asm) • [sprite editor](https://github.com/Bricktech2000/Atto-8/blob/master/test/utils/pixedit.asm) • [Tetris clone](https://github.com/Bricktech2000/Atto-8/blob/master/test/games/tetris.asm) • [self-assembling native assembler](https://github.com/Bricktech2000/Atto-8/blob/master/test/utils/min-asm.asm) • [postfix notation calculator](https://github.com/Bricktech2000/Atto-8/blob/master/test/utils/calc.asm).
- Built microcomputer in hardware using discrete 74HC-series logic chips on breadboards.

### Atto-8 C Compiler

_A rudimentary C99 compiler for the Atto-8 microarchitecture_ `Rust • C • Assembly`

- Building C99 compiler from scratch in Rust targeting Atto-8 Assembly language.
- Developed extensive C standard library, including [heap allocator](https://github.com/Bricktech2000/Atto-8/blob/master/lib/stdlib.asm) supporting **malloc and free** and [string handling functions](https://github.com/Bricktech2000/Atto-8/blob/master/lib/string.asm) such as **strlen and memcpy**.
- Hand-wrote [printf implementation](https://github.com/Bricktech2000/Atto-8/blob/master/lib/stdio.asm) in Assembly which supports conversion specifiers %d, %u, %x, %c, %s and %p, increasing debugging efficiency and convenience.

### [DBLess Password Manager](https://github.com/Bricktech2000/DBLess)

_A hash-based, database-less password manager_ `C • Python`

- Devised [custom cryptographic procedure](https://github.com/Bricktech2000/DBLess/blob/master/src/dbless.py) based on SHA-256 in Python which deterministically generates passwords on demand without requiring encryption or password storage.
- Reimplemented password generation algorithm in C for use as [interactive CLI tool](https://github.com/Bricktech2000/DBLess/blob/master/src/dbless.c).

### [Personal Portfolio](https://emilien.ca/)

_A portfolio for sharing various projects_ `Markdown • Next.js`

- Designed and implemented appealing UI and optimized UX using Google Search Console resulting in over **15 000 unique visitors** to portfolio website a month.
- Leveraged Cloudflare caching system and optimized site-wide accessibility resulting in Lighthouse score consistently over **95%**.

### [Legacy Protocol](https://devpost.com/software/legacy-protocol)

_Submission for DeFi The Conventional 2022_ `React • Rust`

- Won **first place** in Finance category of Canada's largest DeFi hackathon along with **2500$ prize** as part of 3-member team.
- Engineered [MVP smart contract backend and API](https://github.com/Bricktech2000/crypto_will) from scratch in Rust with no prior experience in Web3, all within limited **36-hour timeframe**.
- Worked in collaboration with Terraform Labs post-hackathon to officialize our protocol and secure additional funding prior to Terra Luna collapse.

## Volunteering

### [Hack the Hill Hackathon](http://hackthehill.com/)

_Development Manager — Development Team_ `Ottawa  |  November 2022 — Present`

- Leading development of [open-source participant tracker](https://github.com/HacktheHill/track-the-hack) built with Next.js and Prisma, used by over **1000 hackers** and **50 organizers** throughout hackathon.
- Built and maintained internal sporsorship payment portal powered by Stripe and React.js in collaboration with infrastructure and sponsorship teams, enabling processing of over **20 000$**.

### [uOttawa Computer Science Club](https://uocsclub.ca/)

_Club Executive_ `University of Ottawa  |  June 2022 — Present`

- Building community of **over 1000** computer science students at the University of Ottawa.
- Collaborated with both other executives to brainstorm, organize and schedule a dozen events by designing marketing material using Figma and organizing workshops for  over **100 students**.

## Experience
