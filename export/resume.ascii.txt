COHERE
[Senior Data Quality Specialist --- Advanced Mathematics]        Freelance | October 2024--Present
  - Writing, auditing and correcting LLM prompts and responses with utmost attention to detail
    to  produce  SPOTLESS  TRAINING  DATA in formal logic, combinatorics, number theory, graph
    theory and optimization.

--- PROJECTS --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LTRE REGEX ENGINE <https://github.com/Bricktech2000/LTRE>
[A fast regular expression library written in C99]                                               C
  - Built  regex engine in C99 that compiles regular expressions down to minimal deterministic
    finite automata to match input strings in LINEAR TIME without backtracking.
  - Wrote  extensive  test  suite of over 400 TESTS to ensure end-to-end correctness of engine
    and catch regressions.
  - Developed  grep-like  tool  as real-world stress test for engine, achieving performance on
    par with GNU grep.

ATTO-8 MICROCOMPUTER <https://github.com/Bricktech2000/Atto-8>
[A minimalist 8-bit microcomputer with stack-based microprocessor]             Rust - C - Assembly
  - Designed  entire  microcomputer  from  from  logic gates upward, including instruction set
    architecture,  from-scratch  assembler  and  cross-platform emulator, totaling over 20 000
    SLOC and 750 HOURS of work.
  - Wrote  various utilities in Assembly running natively on microcomputer --- Wozmon-inspired
    memory  monitor - 16x16 sprite editor - Tetris clone - native assembler - postfix notation
    calculator.
  - Built  microcomputer  in  hardware  by  hand-wiring  discrete  74HC-series  logic chips on
    breadboards.

ATTO-8 C COMPILER
[A rudimentary C99 compiler for the Atto-8 microarchitecture]                  Rust - C - Assembly
  - Building  C99 compiler from scratch in Rust targeting Atto-8 Assembly language, consisting
    of preprocessor, parser, typechecker, optimizer and code generator.
  - Implemented  dead  code elimination, constant folding and strength reduction, resulting in
    20%  INCREASE  in  generated code performance and 10% REDUCTION in binary size across test
    suite.
  - Developed  extensive  C  standard  library, including heap allocator supporting MALLOC AND
    FREE,  string  handling  functions  such  as  STRLEN  AND MEMCPY and input/output routines
    including GETLINE AND PRINTF.
