-- PROJECTS --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ATTO-8 MICROCOMPUTER <https://github.com/Bricktech2000/Atto-8>
[A minimalist 8-bit microcomputer with stack-based microprocessor]            Rust - C - Assembly
- Designed ecosystem of hardware and software from logic gates upward, including instruction
  set architecture, from-scratch assembler and cross-platform emulator, totaling over 20 000
  SLOC and 750 HOURS of work.
- Wrote  various  demos  in  Assembly  running natively on microcomputer -- memory monitor -
  sprite editor - Tetris clone - native assembler - postfix notation calculator.
- Built microcomputer in hardware using discrete 74HC-series logic chips on breadboards.

ATTO-8 C COMPILER
[A rudimentary C99 compiler for the Atto-8 microarchitecture]                 Rust - C - Assembly
- Building  C99 compiler from sctatch in Rust targeting Atto-8 Assembly language, consisting
  of preprocessor, parser, typechecker, optimizer and code generator.
- Implemented  dead  code  elimination, constant folding and strength reduction resulting in
  average of 20% INCREASE in execution speed and 10% REDUCTION in binary size.
- Developed  extensive  C  standard  library, including heap allocator supporting MALLOC AND
  FREE,  string  handling  functions  such  as  STRLEN  AND MEMCPY and input/output routines
  including PRINTF supporting conversion specifiers %d, %u, %x, %c, %s and %p.

LTRE REGEX ENGINE <https://github.com/Bricktech2000/LTRE>
[A fast regular expression library written in C99]                                              C
- Built  regex engine in C99 which compiles regular expressions down to deterministic finite
  automata to match input strings in LINEAR TIME without backtracking.
- Wrote extensive test suite of over 100 TESTS to ensure end-to-end correctness of engine.
- Developed  grep-like tool supporting flags -v, -x, -i, -n and -c as real-world stress test
  for engine.

DBLESS PASSWORD MANAGER <https://github.com/Bricktech2000/DBLess>
[A hash-based, database-less password manager]                                         C - Python
- Devised custom hash procedure based on SHA-256 in Python which deterministically generates
  passwords on demand without requiring encryption or password storage.
- Reimplemented  password  generation algorithm in C along with SHA-256 routines as per FIPS
  PUB 180-4 for use as interactive CLI tool.
