--- EXPERIENCE -----------------------------------------------------------------

ECOSAFESENSE
[Firmware Engineer]                               Ottawa | October 2024--Present
  - Writing  firmware  for  ESP32-based air quality sensor and complementary
    test bench.

COHERE
[Senior Data Quality Specialist --- Advanced Mathematics]    Freelance | October
2024--April 2025
  - Wrote,  audited  and  corrected  LLM  prompts  and  responses to produce
    SPOTLESS  TRAINING  DATA  in formal logic, combinatorics, number theory,
    graph theory and mathematical optimization.

--- PROJECTS -------------------------------------------------------------------

DFA REGEX ENGINE <https://github.com/Bricktech2000/LTRE>
  - Built  regex  engine  in  C99  that compiles regular expressions down to
    minimal  deterministic  finite automata to match input strings in LINEAR
    TIME without backtracking.
  - Wrote  extensive  test  suite  of  over  500  TESTS to ensure end-to-end
    correctness of engine and catch regressions.
  - Developed  grep-like  tool  as  real-world  stress  test  for engine and
    achieved performance on par with GNU grep.

BREADBOARD MICROCOMPUTER <https://github.com/Bricktech2000/Atto-8>
  - Designed  8-bit  microcomputer  from  from logic gates upward, including
    instruction  set architecture, from-scratch assembler and cross-platform
    emulator in Rust, totaling over 20 000 SLOC and 750 HOURS of work.
  - Wrote  various  utilities  in  Assembly  running  natively  on
    microcomputer --- Wozmon-inspired memory monitor - 16x16 sprite editor -
    Tetris clone - native assembler - postfix notation calculator.
  - Built  microcomputer  in  hardware  by  hand-wiring discrete 74HC-series
    logic chips on breadboards.

RUDIMENTARY C COMPILER <https://github.com/Bricktech2000/Atto-8/blob/master/cc>
  - Building  C99  compiler  from  scratch  in  Rust  targeting  breadboard
    microcomputer's instruction set.
  - Implemented  dead  code  elimination,  constant  folding  and  strength
    reduction,  resulting  in 20% INCREASE in generated code performance and
    10% REDUCTION in binary size across test suite.
  - Developed  extensive  C  standard  library,  including  heap  allocator
    supporting MALLOC AND FREE, string handling functions such as STRLEN AND
    MEMCPY and input/output routines including GETLINE AND PRINTF.

MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON <https://github.com/Bricktech2000/Autodiff>
  - Wrote  static  reverse-mode automatic differentiation library in C99 for
    use in deep learning.
  - Designed multilayer perceptron model and implemented stochastic gradient
    descent, momentum and L2 regularization, achieving 97% ACCURACY on MNIST
    database after 3 minutes training on 16 threads.
