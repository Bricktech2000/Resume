--- EXPERIENCE ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ECOSAFESENSE
[Firmware Engineer]                                                 Ottawa | October 2024--Present

ZEPTILE SOFTWARE
[Software Engineer --- Web3]                                   Remote | October 2022--October 2023
  - Implemented  various  smart  contracts  in Solidity and ensured 100% TEST COVERAGE through
    Chai and Hardhat.

--- PROJECTS --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LTRE REGEX ENGINE <https://github.com/Bricktech2000/LTRE>
[A fast regular expression library written in C99]                                               C
  - Built  regex engine in C99 that compiles regular expressions down to minimal deterministic
    finite automata to match input strings in LINEAR TIME without backtracking.
  - Wrote  extensive  test  suite of over 300 TESTS to ensure end-to-end correctness of engine
    and catch regressions.
  - Developed  grep-like  tool as real-world stress test for engine, with command-line options
    for  case-insensitive  and  smart-case  matching,  fixed-string  patterns,  full-match and
    partial-match searches, and more.

ATTO-8 MICROCOMPUTER <https://github.com/Bricktech2000/Atto-8>
[A minimalist 8-bit microcomputer with stack-based microprocessor]             Rust - C - Assembly
  - Designed  entire  microcomputer  from  from  logic gates upward, including instruction set
    architecture,  from-scratch  assembler  and  cross-platform emulator, totaling over 20 000
    SLOC and 750 HOURS of work.
  - Wrote  various utilities in Assembly running natively on microcomputer --- Wozmon-inspired
    memory  monitor - 16x16 sprite editor - Tetris clone - native assembler - postfix notation
    calculator.
  - Built  microcomputer  in  hardware  by  hand-wiring  discrete  74HC-series  logic chips on
    breadboards.

ATTO-8 C COMPILER
[A rudimentary C99 compiler for the Atto-8 microarchitecture]                  Rust - C - Assembly
  - Building  C99 compiler from scratch in Rust targeting Atto-8 Assembly language, consisting
    of preprocessor, parser, typechecker, optimizer and code generator.
  - Implemented  dead  code elimination, constant folding and strength reduction, resulting in
    average of 20% INCREASE in generated code performance and 10% REDUCTION in binary size.
  - Developed  extensive  C  standard  library, including heap allocator supporting MALLOC AND
    FREE,  string  handling  functions  such  as  STRLEN  AND MEMCPY and input/output routines
    including PRINTF supporting conversion specifiers %d, %u, %x, %c, %s and %p.

DBLESS PASSWORD MANAGER <https://github.com/Bricktech2000/DBLess>
[A hash-based, database-less password manager]                                          C - Python
  - Devised custom hash procedure based on SHA-256 in Python which deterministically generates
    passwords on demand without requiring encryption or password storage.
  - Reimplemented  password  generation algorithm in C along with SHA-256 routines as per FIPS
    PUB 180-4 for use as interactive CLI tool.
