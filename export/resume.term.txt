--- PROJECTS -------------------------------------------------------------------

[1mDFA Regex Engine[0m <https://github.com/Bricktech2000/LTRE>
  - Built  regex  engine  in  C99  that compiles regular expressions down to
    minimal  deterministic  finite automata to match input strings in [1mlinear
    time[0m without backtracking.
  - Wrote  extensive  test  suite  of  over  [1m500  tests[0m to ensure end-to-end
    correctness of engine and catch regressions.
  - Developed  grep-like  tool  as  real-world  stress  test  for engine and
    achieved performance on par with GNU grep.
