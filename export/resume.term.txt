[1mLTRE Regex Engine[0m <https://github.com/Bricktech2000/LTRE>
[[3mA fast regular expression library written in C99[0m]                                               [3mC[0m
  - Built  regex engine in C99 that compiles regular expressions down to minimal deterministic
    finite automata to match input strings in [1mlinear time[0m without backtracking.
  - Wrote  extensive  test  suite of over [1m400 tests[0m to ensure end-to-end correctness of engine
    and catch regressions.
